There is a map, you can imagine it as an N-dimensional canvas. 
The map has only integer positions like [1, 2], no decimals allowed! 
We will use a Cartesian coordinate system for it. You (a player) 
are assigned a unique color. In addition, you have a set of what we call 'worker'.

Each 'worker' has a palette of your unique color and can paint the map. 
However, he can only paint in the vertical and horizontal directions, and the squares 
that are directly connected to the squares that are directly connected to its position. 
This is, like a rook in chess but can only move one square at a time. But beware, 
there are also more players on the map!

The challenge will be as follows. Every X units of time there will be an iteration of the game, we call it a tick. 
game, we call it a tick. On each tick each player decides where his workers should go. 
workers. On the next tick, if there are no collisions (see the rules section for more details) 
the workers will be placed on the for more details) the workers will be placed in the defined position. 
When a worker moves to a position, he paints his path with the color of that worker. 
color of that worker. Therefore, after a few ticks the map will be a beautiful and 
colorful canvas with the colors of the players.
